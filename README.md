# [Project 1: Interactive Probability Visualizations](https://github.com/datasciencesociety/Probability_Visualization) 2019
* Created interactive visualization of probability distributions both discrete and continious.
* Using the library Holoviews.
* Using scipy to generate the data, that is ploted with histograms, pdf (probability density function) or pmf (probability mass function) for the descrete and cdf (cumulative density functions)
* There are widgets to change the parameters



# [Project 2: Ball Image Classifier](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities. 

I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.
