# [Interactive Probability Visualizations 2019](https://github.com/datasciencesociety/Probability_Visualization)
There is short description of each of the probability distributions Thiss includes both discrete and continuous probability distributions. Some of the feature are. Holoviews is used to make the visualizations. The visualizations are plots of histograms, pdf (probability density function) or pmf (probability mass function) for the discrete and cdf (cumulative density functions). Sliders are added as widgets to change the parameters. 
Alternative links for the code with visualizations can be viewed at Kaggle:

# [Ball Image Classifier](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities. 

I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.
